# In the following two tasks, the deployed gtms are clustered. 
# As these are interactive CLI tools on BIG-IP, we'll need to leverage expect scripts,
# ex. http://marvelley.com/blog/2014/04/23/handling-interactive-ansible-tasks/
# NOTE: expect modules don't exist in anywhere on bigip, so we'll do this as a local action

#./gtm_expect.py admin 1.1.1.1 bigip_add admin 2.2.2.2 'mypassword'
# Note, in production, you really want to use MGMT ports for inital gtm_add/bigip_add functions 
# as they requires ssh and you only want to expose 4353 (big3d communication) on any pubic self-ips
